## README

The code in the .py files has been compiled in such a way that minimal input is needed from the user to reproduce the results discussed in the report. The user must have the following libraries installed to run the code:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Imblearn
- Random

### Instructions to run each file
#### finalKNN.py
To run this file, the user only needs to update the fpath variable in line 61 to the filepath location of the 'diabetes.csv' on your computer. After updating this variable, the code should run as intended.

#### decisionTree.py and randomForest.py
These files have similar structures. The user only needs to update the fpath variable in line 20 to the filepath location of the 'diabetes.csv' on your computer. After updating this variable, the code should run as intended. 

- Note that the randomForest.py file will take approximately 10 minutes to run.
